<tr><td><p  align="justify">I'm <i>that</i> <b>Eric Mortensen</b>. I've spent my career working in what was once called "new media", and you might remember some of it, like <a href="http://linkfilter.net">Linklfiter</a> (early 2000s, currently relaunching), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327074715/http://blip.tv/">Blip</a> (late 2000s), <a href="http://thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> (mid 2010s), and <a href="http://fatedmates.net">Fated Mates</a> (currently). You also might also be familiar with projects like <a href="http://imageoscillite.com">Image Oscillite</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scruti_ny">scrutiNY</a>, and my A/V installations and event production work with the <a href="http://disorient.info">Disorient</a> collective (2010s).</p>
