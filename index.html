I'm <b>Eric Mortensen</b> and I've spent my career working in what was once called "new media.” You might remember some of it, like <a href="http://linkfilter.net">Linkfilter</a> (early 2000s, currently relaunching), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327074715/http://blip.tv/">Blip</a> (late 2000s), <a href="http://thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> (mid 2010s), and <a href="http://fatedmates.net">Fated Mates</a> (currently). You might also be familiar with my ongoing projects like <a href="http://imageoscillite.com">Image Oscillite</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scruti_ny">scrutiNY</a>, and my interactive A/V installations and event production work with the <a href="http://disorient.info">Disorient</a> collective.

I'm passionate about the power of content and community—words that are too often overused, but are more essential today than ever before. They’re vital to art, to culture and to a strong, impassioned society, and central to the efforts of any organization with a goal to reach, connect with, and influence the world. 
</p>

I've spent my career working at the intersection of great content and impassioned communities, and I am eager to expand this work—in service to a better future for our country and planet.
