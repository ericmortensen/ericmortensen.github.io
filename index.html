<tr><td><p  align="justify">I'm <b>Eric Mortensen</b> and I've spent my career working in what was once called "new media", and you might remember some of it, like <a href="http://linkfilter.net">linkfilter</a> (early 2000s, currently relaunching), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120327074715/http://blip.tv/">Blip</a> (late 2000s), <a href="http://thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> (mid 2010s), and <a href="http://fatedmates.net">Fated Mates</a> (currently). You might also be familiar with projects like <a href="http://imageoscillite.com">Image Oscillite</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scruti_ny">scrutiNY</a>, and my interactive A/V installations and event production work with the <a href="http://disorient.info">Disorient</a> collective (2010s).</p>

<tr><td>I'm passionate about content and community, two words that are overused to the point of appearing to lose all meaning. But they're incredibly important and central to the efforts of any organization reaching, connecting with, and influencing the world. I've been fortunate to spend my career doing this work in service of things I believe in and I'm currently doubling down on that, looking to make the greatest impact in service of a better future for our country and planet.
