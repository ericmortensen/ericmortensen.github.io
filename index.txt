"Of course the sands of Present Time are running out from under our feet. And why not? 
The Great Conundrum: 'What are we here for?' is all that ever held us here in the first place. 
Fear. The answer to the Riddle of the Ages has actually been out in the street since the First 
Step in Space. Who runs may read but few people run fast enough. What are we here for? Does 
the great metaphysical nut revolve around that? Well, I'll crack it for you, right now. 
What are we here for? We are here to go!"
